# Romi Challenge 2 Auto

## Description

Best run 15.90 seconds, two batteries knocked down (2 penalty points)

## Notes

We found it extremely difficult to get the romi to follow paths consistently. No matter how much we calibrated the gyro or what hoops we went through, we saw inconsistencies. 

The team that worked on the romi's were not programmers, and we decided that learning vision code was going to be difficult in the time span allowed. Facing problems with the gyros and the inconsistencies was disenhartening.
